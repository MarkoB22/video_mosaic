# Video mosaic

This section is used to show collections (or any other sort of content) and has a functionality where video can be used instead of image

The image, video, title, button and link can all be changed trough customize, so user is not only locked to use this section for collections, even thought that was the main purpose.

Main css file and video API libraries are not included in this showcase
